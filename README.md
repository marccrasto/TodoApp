# TodoApp
This is my first attempt at tackling 'Application Development'. It is a simple TodoApp that was created with HTML, CSS and Javascript.
The app allows you to enter todo tasks and strike them out as you complete them (as well as delete them).

First off, I apologise for the 'documentation hell' that you are about to witness when you open the files. I just added them as my way of remembering how everything works (since I'm new to HTML, CSS and Javascript) and as I create more apps and store them on GitHub, the documentation will reduce.

Requirements:
 - Microsoft VSCode with Live Server extension enabled.

How to run:
 - Simply right-click on the HTML file (after opening the project files on VSCode) and click on Live Server.

So far this has worked on my system fine, and hopefully it should work without any issues on yours too! Have fun.
